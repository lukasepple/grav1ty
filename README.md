# grav2ty :rocket:

![screenshot of grav2ty showing a spaceship and a planet](./grav2ty-first-commit.png)

the most realistic asteroids-like game in existence.

## controls

* `up`: increase thruster power (ship acceleration)
* `down`: decrease thruster power (ship acceleration)
* `left`: rotate ship counter-clockwise
* `right`: rotate ship clockwise
* `c`: toggle centered view

## roadmap

- [x] simulation of gravity
- [x] controllable spaceship
- [ ] collision detection
- [ ] make measurements more realistic
- [ ] allow for zooming the viewport
- [ ] time scaling / fast forward
- [ ] rework HUD, log additional info to console
- [ ] cosmetics (improved models, stars, â€¦)
- [ ] projectiles & targets
- [ ] multi player support (?)
- [ ] switch rendering engine
- [ ] orbit visualization / prediction
